#Emergency Vehicle Dispatching System:

  We design an emergency vehicle dispatching system that have three different types of emergency vehicles:
  1 (Ambulance), 2 (Fire Truck), 3 (Police car).  
 Every  user can request more than one emergency vehicle. The user should enter the type of vehicle that he need.
 Also, how many vehicle he need.
  We Implement Dijkstra algorithm that processes requests one by one. 
  For each request, the algorithm should try to find the closest available emergency vehicle  â€¢ 
 
 Software:
 Visual Studio - c#

Resources:
we write three CSV file.
Node file for build graph.
Data file that store mergency vehicle type, zipcode,  and avaliblity.
Edge File to store every edge information Source, Destiation, Cost.
