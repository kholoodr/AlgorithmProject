Dijkstra algorithm:
Is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree.
This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.
For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost between that vertex and every other vertex.
